Linux-Remote Server are Linux-based virtual machines (VMs) that run on top of virtualized hardware
VMs are managed using a terminal and SSH. Youâ€™ll need to have an SSH client and, optionally, an SSH key pair. Clients generally authenticate either using passwords (which are less secure and not recommended) or SSH keys (which are very secure and strongly recommended).
We recommend you use SSH keys to connect to your VM.
